Step 6: Create Plan 3 - "Hero Section"
Plan Name: "Hero Section - Main Landing"
Plan Description:
Create an impactful, full-screen hero section that immediately captures
attention with bold typography, animations, and metallic aesthetic.

Tasks:
Task 1: Hero Component Structure
Create components/sections/Hero.tsx:
- Full viewport height (min-h-screen)
- Dark background (#0a0a0a)
- Centered content with max-width container
- Flex layout for vertical/horizontal centering

Task 2: Hero Content & Typography
Add hero content:
- Main headline: "Crafting Metal & Wood into Art" (text-6xl, bold, white)
- Subheadline: "Custom metalwork and woodworking for residential and commercial projects" (text-xl, steel gray)
- Two CTA buttons:
  * Primary: "View Portfolio" (bronze background, hover effects)
  * Secondary: "Get a Quote" (bronze outline, hover fill)
- Use proper spacing and typography hierarchy

Task 3: Hero Background Effect
Add visual interest:
- Subtle grid pattern overlay (CSS or SVG)
- Or radial gradient from center
- Metallic texture hints
- Keep it subtle, not distracting

Task 4: Hero Animations
Add Framer Motion animations:
- Fade in main headline (delay 0.2s)
- Fade in subheadline (delay 0.4s)
- Fade in buttons (delay 0.6s)
- All with smooth easing
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

Task 5: Update Homepage
Update app/page.tsx:
- Import Hero component
- Add Hero as first section
- Basic page structure with <main> tag
