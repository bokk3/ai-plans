# Development Rules

## General
- Use **Next.js 16** and **React 19**.
- Use **TypeScript** for all code.
- Use **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling.
- Use **SQLite** for the database.
- Ensure all animations run at **60fps**.

## Audio Handling
- Use **WaveSurfer.js** (or Peaks.js) for waveform visualization.
- Generate waveforms upon track upload if possible, or on the fly.
- Store audio files in `/public/uploads/audio/`.
- Ensure the audio player is persistent across page navigations (use a global context or layout).

## Admin & Authentication
- Use a single **Admin Password** (from `.env`) for simplicity.
- Implement session-based authentication (JWT or simple token).
- Protect all `/admin` routes.
- Auto-logout after inactivity.

## File Uploads
- Use **React Dropzone** for drag-and-drop uploads.
- Validate file types and sizes on the client and server.
- Store files locally in `/public/uploads/` organized by type (`audio`, `images`, `videos`).

## Database
- Use `better-sqlite3` for synchronous SQLite operations (or `sqlite` / `libsql` if preferred for Next.js).
- Define schema in `schema.sql`.
- Use Server Actions for all database mutations.

## WYSIWYG Editor
- Use **TipTap** or **Lexical** for the blog editor.
- Support image uploads within the editor.
- Sanitize HTML output before rendering.

## Code Quality
- Follow strict TypeScript rules.
- Use `zod` for all form and API validation.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Use `lucide-react` for icons.
